The Coronavirus lockdown last year had *some* silver linings. For me, one was getting more in touch with my local area and wildlife.

I received a [great book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5716135-collins-complete-guide-to-british-birds) detailing both common and rarer British birds, and where and when you’re likely to spot them. I quickly realised birding was basically real life Pokémon. \
\
Beyond observation, my obsession quickly became ‘gotta *capture* ‘em all’ (on camera). I’m no photographer but my trusty [Canon PowerShot](https://www.canon.co.uk/for_home/product_finder/cameras/digital_camera/powershot/powershot_sx510_hs/) has a decent zoom for its size and does a great job of capturing the flighty subjects for later identification.

I’ll kick off the birding blog with the usual suspects: birds I’ve seen in my Stockport (and more recently Solihull) garden and local area...
