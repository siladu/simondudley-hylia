...Standard for Suffolk (credit to Lydia for this title!)

We wanted to explore some corners of the country we haven't visited before, so we kicked off our goodbye tour of the UK with a bird-inspired visit to Norfolk and Suffolk. Every unusual bird I read about in my book seemed to hail from Norfolk so it seemed an obvious choice for this burgeoning hobby.
