Later this year I'm moving from the land of the Queen to Queensland.

I am emigrating from Manchester, UK to Brisbane, Australia.

Join me as I face my fear of spiders and continue my software development career down under. I have worked for years in the UK as a Java web dev and will be joining a remote-first Ethereum-based blockchain company.

This blog will focus on the interesting software problems I encounter as I get stuck into the rabbit hole that is blockchain and cryptocurrency, as well as an immigrant's perspective of life in Australia. I may throw a few geeky birding posts in here too.
